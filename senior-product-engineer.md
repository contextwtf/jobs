# Senior product engineer

We're interested in hiring a senior product engineer to join Context to help us
build rug.fun.

This role is remote for people in North American and European time zones only.
If you are based in SF and prefer in person, we're happy to offer flexible
remote/in person work.

### Working at Context

Context is a company formed with the goal of making web3 more fun and human.

We are the founding team behind [mint.fun](https://mint.fun).
[mint.fun](https://mint.fun) was acquired by Zora in 2024.

We now work on [rug.fun](https://rug.fun) â€“ a new way to launch tokens
competitively onchain. While rug.fun is early, we believe it has the potential
to be the next important social primitive in crypto.

We're an early stage startup that's raised $19,500,000 from investors like
[Variant](https://variant.fund), [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.xyz), and [Sam
Altman](https://twitter.com/sama) to build the future of human readable web3.

### This role

We are looking for a full stack product engineer to help us build rug.fun. You'll
work closely with our head designer building out our design system and new features. You'll report directly to [our CEO](https://x.com/worm_emoji).

What we're looking for:

- deep expertise with Next/React/Typescript
- someone who is detail oriented and can notice when that button is 2px misaligned
- a front-end bar raiser. You bring value to code reviews
- experience with onchain apps is nice but not required. Major plus if you know
  what a rug pull is and why we use the npm package "wagmi".

### Benefits and compensation

For this role, we're offering a salary range of $175K-$275K + generous equity.
We also have benefits such as:

- fully covered dental & health insurance for you and dependents
- yearly offsites where you can meet the team in person
- a hybrid/flex remote culture. Come into the SF office if you want to, or work
  remotely (for North American and European time zones only).

### Applying and our process

To get started, please email [rugengineer@rug.fun](mailto:rugengineer@rug.fun) with a
link to some code you are proud of. We're really excited to see your portfolio
and prioritize applications that show a body of work.

Once we get a chance to read your application, we'll move to a phone interview
where we can discuss your background, work and what you want in a job. You'll
have the opportunity to ask any questions about Context of course.

After getting to meet you, if it's a good fit, we'll offer you a paid work
project to get a sense of how you solve problems. If we move to a formal
interview, we'll definitely use your work sample to anchor our conversations -
why did you use X approach?

From there, we're flexible about how to move forward. For candidates we're
excited about, we can either offer you a paid contracting role or move to a full
time offer. It can be nice to have a full blown work trial, but we understand
that might not work for everyone.

If you have any questions or feedback about this process, please do ask! We
definitely want to iterate on it to make it as no nonsense, transparent, and
friendly as possible.
