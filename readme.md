# Would be cool if you hired me

I'm Divyansh — a full-stack developer who vibes with your love for building strange and wonderful things. I've shipped 15+ full-stack projects and obsess over smooth UX and clean APIs.

You like weird? I shipped a productivity app that turns your daily tasks into a battle royale with your friends.

You like building fast? I’ve shipped apps over weekends with full auth, data sync, and deployment.

Not a React Server Components expert (yet), but give me a week(or so) and I’ll send you a (barely) working clone of rug.fun. 

I might not be the best engineer you’ve seen yet — but I’ll bring relentless energy, rapid iteration, and a willingness to learn whatever it takes.
