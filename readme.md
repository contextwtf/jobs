# Context

Context is a company formed with the goal of making web3 more fun and human.

We are the founding team behind [mint.fun](https://mint.fun).
[mint.fun](https://mint.fun) was acquired by Zora in 2024.

We now work on [rug.fun](https://rug.fun) – a new way to launch tokens
competitively onchain.

Our small but passionate team is committed to delivering thoughtful products
through rigorous engineering. We’ve raised $19,500,000 from
[Variant](https://variant.fund), [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama), and
[Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.xyz) to create the best web3 products possible.
