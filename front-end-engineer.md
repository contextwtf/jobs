### Front end engineer

We're interested in hiring a Front End Engineer to join Context to
help us build mint.fun.

This role is remote for people in North American time zones only. If you are
based in SF and prefer in person, we're happy to offer flexible remote/in
person work.

## Working at Context

Context builds web3 products we wish existed. Our mission is to use smart
engineering to build simple, human readable interfaces on the vast cultural and
technical world of blockchain media.

Our primary product, [mint.fun](https://mint.fun), turns smart contracts into
beautiful, polished UI. NFT enthusiasts use us as a sort of "Reddit of web3" to
discover what NFT projects to mint right now, and artists use us as a launchpad
to start new projects and connect with their audience without writing any code.

We also build open source infrastructure to serve our community. Our primary
open source tool, [Lanyard](https://lanyard.org), opens up important off-chain
data to decentralize allowlist mint information.

We're an early stage startup that's raised $19,500,000 from investors like
[Variant](https://variant.fun), [Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.xyz), and [Sam
Altman](https://twitter.com/sama) to build the future of human readable web3.

### This role

Context is looking for a front end engineer to work on mint.fun. You'll work
closely with our head designer building out our design system and new features
across our products. You'll report directly to our CEO leading product.

What we’re looking for:

- Expertise and leadership on frontend tooling
- Deep experience with Next/React/Typescript
- Someone who is detail oriented and can notice when that button is 2px
  misaligned
- A front-end bar raiser. You bring value to code reviews
- Experience with Ethereum and NFTs a major plus but not required – we can teach
  you

### Benefits and compensation

For this role, we're offering a salary range of $150-200K + generous equity. We
also have benefits such as:

- fully covered dental & health insurance for you and dependents
- quarterly offsites with the team, including one "fun" offsite per year
- a hybrid/flex remote culture. Come into the SF office if you want to, or work
  remotely

### Applying and our process

To get started, please email [jobs@context.app](mailto:jobs@context.app) with a
link to some code you are proud of. We're really excited to read your code
samples and greatly prioritize applications that include code.

Once we get a chance to read your application, we'll move to a phone interview
where we can discuss your background, work and what you want in a job. You'll
have the opportunity to ask any questions about Context of course.

After getting to meet you, if it's a good fit, we'll offer you a paid work
project to get a sense of how you solve problems. If we move to a formal
interview, we'll definitely use your work sample to anchor our conversations -
why did you choose X technology or why did you use Y approach?

From there, we're flexible about how to move forward. For candidates we're
excited about, we can either offer you a paid contracting role or move to a full
time offer. It can be nice to have a full blown work trial, but we understand
that might not work for everyone.

If you have any questions or feedback about this process, please do ask! We
definitely want to iterate on it to make it as no nonsense, transparent, and
friendly as possible.
